## discardRAW.py
I shoot in raw + jpeg. Since raw files take a while to load, I usually do my initial  culling of dud photos by going through the jpegs and deleting ones I don't want to keep.

This is a small python script to find raw files that don't have a corresponding jpeg and move them to a discard directory.
